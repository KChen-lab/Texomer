Title: Segmentation of single- and multi-track copy number data by
        penalized least squares regression.
Version: 1.6.0
Author: Gro Nilsen, Knut Liestoel and Ole Christian Lingjaerde.
Maintainer: Gro Nilsen <gronilse@ifi.uio.no>
Description: Penalized least squares regression is applied to fit
        piecewise constant curves to copy number data to locate genomic
        regions of constant copy number. Procedures are available for
        individual segmentation of each sample, joint segmentation of
        several samples and joint segmentation of the two data tracks
        from SNP-arrays. Several plotting functions are available for
        visualization of the data and the segmentation results.
