 NEWS/ChangeLog for doMC
-------------------------

1.3.5  2017-12-08
    o  Change test report path for compliance with CRAN policies.
	
1.3.3   2014-02-25
    o   Modified so that vignette uses no more than two workers.
        
1.3.2   2013-11-18
    o   Modified to check for errors early to avoid calling combine function
        when errors occur. 
        
1.3.1   2013-10-28
    o   Added iterators, parallel, and utils to NAMESPACE imports.
	o   Removed restriction to Unix, since parallel exists on Windows.
	    (However, as with parallel's multicore functionality, only
		one core is supported on Windows.)
	
1.3.0   2013-02-19
    o   Changed dependency on multicore package to parallel.

1.2.5   2012-04-11
    o   Moved vignettes to new preferred location.

1.2.4   2012-02-24
    o   Modified default cores computation to use parallel package tools 
	    from R 2.14.0 and later if possible.
	o   Modified doRUnit.R to use two cores when run during R CMD check.
	
1.2.3   2011-08-15
    o   Added support for package options via registerDoMC
    o   Added package option "nocompile" to disable compiler support


1.2.2   2011-05-16
    o   Added support for the compiler package in R 2.13.0
    o   Enhanced unit tests to enable running them under R CMD check.


1.2.1   2010-01-25
    o   Changed license to GPL-2
    o   Error handling for the doMC backend should now be correct.  If 
        .errorhandling is set to anything other than 'stop', it should return 
        an array containing the results of all iterations which did not cause 
        errors. (From a bug report by Brian Peterson)


1.2.0   2009-10-05
    o   added support for all of the mclapply options via the foreach
        .options.multicore argument
    o   added a "Getting Started" vignette.
    o   added examples directory


1.1.1   2009-06-29
    o   added cores option to registerDoMC
    o   fixed bug that caused getDoParWorkers to report incorrect value


1.1.0   2009-06-26
    o   initial public release
